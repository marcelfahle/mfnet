				<p>
					I am a Full-Stack-Developer with 17+ years of experience. My adventures in code led me from  early experiments in Perl to many years working with Flash/ActionScript and PHP.
				</p>

				<p>
					But that was only until I discovered the beautiful Ruby language, which became my weapon of choice for years to come, often paired with the powerful Ruby on Rails Framework.
				</p>

				<p>
					While always keeping a strong Frontend foundation, I nowadays feel more at home in Full JavaScript Stacks, challenging myself with functional programming concepts, serverless architectures, reactivity and performance. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Besides all of that, I love to read, run, travel and all things cinematography.
				</p>

				<p>
					And yes, I am for hire. Hit me up, donâ€™t be shy! :-)
